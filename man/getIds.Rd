}
\arguments{
\item{nestedList}{A JSON derived nested list of Structure relationships from Allen Brain Atlas's StructureGraph}

\item{name}{Brain structure name substring}
}
\value{
ids A dictionary of Structures that contain the name with their IDs
}
\description{
In the Allen Brain Atlas, a Structure represents a neuroanatomical region of interest. Structures are grouped into Ontologies and organized in a hierarchy or StructureGraph. The StructureGraph for the Developing Mouse Brain Atlas is provided here under data/structureID.rda. This function allows you to browse Structures by name and ID given a name substring.
